    <h3>Information</h3>
    <h3 class="info">Velociraptor [meaning swift'swift thief'] is a genus of small dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, about 75 million to 71 million years ago. Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation, Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China.</h3>
    <h3>Facts</h3>
    <h3 class="info">1.Unlike the movies, Velociraptor have been found with feathers mostly in the forearms region making it pretty similiar to an actual bird!</h3>
    <h3 class="info">2.The most famous fossil of the Velociraptor has the creature actually in the middle of a battle with a protoceratops![this creature will be added later]</h3>
    <h3 class="info">3.A velociraptor's tail had it's bones compeletely fused together so even though it's tail coudn't move it gave the raptor extreme balance!</h3>
    <h3 class="info">4.By the looks of it, the velociraptor's [probably] only living ancestor is an actual bird! because the bone structure of the raptor was especially similiar to modern-day birds so it could be possible that a chicken is the successor to the velociraptor! </h3>
