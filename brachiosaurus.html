    <h3>Information</h3>
    <h3 class="info">Brachiosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic, about 154 to 150 million years ago. It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means "deep chest". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons (31.2 and 51.7 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.</h3>
    <h3>Facts</h3>
    <h3 class="info">1.Brachiosaurus probably ate 400 kilograms of food a day!</h3>
    <h3 class="info">2.It was once believed that Brachiosaurus lived in water due to the air sockets in it's body, but that was completely wrong! The dinosaur would become extremely unstable and unbalanced!</h3>
    <h3 class="info">3.It is believed that Brachiosaurus actually lived in herds for either protection against predators or just to eat through forest faster :)</h3>
    <h3 class="info">4.Brachiosaurus is easilly one of the largest dinosaurs yet but the actual largest dinosaurs is the absolute beast of a sauropod, the one and only Argentinosaurus[Dinosaur will be added soon]</h3>
